    <p>
      The forenoon of the first of April, 1911.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Mitchener is at his writing table in the War Office, opening
      letters. On his left is the fireplace, with a fire burning. On his right,
      against the opposite wall is a standing desk with an office stool. The
      door is in the wall behind him, half way between the table and the desk.
      The table is not quite in the middle of the room: it is nearer to the
      hearthrug than to the desk. There is a chair at each end of it for persons
      having business with the general. There is a telephone on the table. Long
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A VOICE OUTSIDE. Votes for Women!
    </p>
    <p>
      The General starts convulsively; snatches a revolver from a drawer, and
      listens in an agony of apprehension. Nothing happens. He puts the revolver
      back, ashamed; wipes his brow; and resumes his work. He is startled afresh
      by the entry of an Orderly. This Orderly is an unsoldierly, slovenly,
      discontented young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Oh, it's only you. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Another one, sir. Shes chained herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Chained herself? How? To what? Weve taken away the railings and
      everything that a chain can be passed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. We forgot the doorscraper, sir. She laid down on the flags
      and got the chain through before she started hollerin. Shes lying there
      now; and she says that youve got the key of the padlock in a letter in a
      buff envelope, and that you will see her when you open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Shes mad. Have the scraper dug up and let her go home with it
      hanging round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Theres a buff envelope there, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Youre all afraid of these women (picking the letter up). It
      does seem to have a key in it. (He opens the letter, and takes out a key
      and a note.) "Dear Mitch"&mdash;Well, I'm dashed!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Yes Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What do you mean by Yes Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Well, you said you was dashed, Sir; and you did look if youll
      excuse my saying it, Sir&mdash;well, you looked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (who has been reading the letter, and is too astonished to
      attend to the Orderlys reply). This is a letter from the Prime Minister
      asking me to release the woman with this key if she padlocks herself, and
      to have her shown up and see her at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (tremulously). Dont do it, governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (angrily). How often have I ordered you not to address me as
      governor. Remember that you are a soldier and not a vulgar civilian.
      Remember also that when a man enters the army he leaves fear behind him.
      Heres the key. Unlock her and show her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Me unlock her! I dursent. Lord knows what she'd do to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (pepperily, rising). Obey your orders instantly, Sir, and dont
      presume to argue. Even if she kills you, it is your duty to die for your
      country. Right about face. March. (The Orderly goes out, trembling.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE VOICE OUTSIDE. Votes for Women! Votes for Women! Votes for Women!
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (mimicking her). Votes for Women! Votes for Women! Votes for
      Women! (in his natural voice) Votes for children! Votes for babies! Votes
      for monkeys! (He posts himself on the hearthrug, and awaits the enemy.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (outside). In you go. (He pushes a panting Suffraget into the
      room.) The person sir. (He withdraws.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Suffraget takes off her tailor made skirt and reveals a pair of
      fashionable trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (horrified). Stop, madam. What are you doing? You must not
      undress in my presence. I protest. Not even your letter from the Prime
      Minister&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SUFFRAGET. My dear Mitchener: I AM the Prime Minister. (He tears off
      his hat and cloak; throws them on the desk; and confronts the General in
      the ordinary costume of a Cabinet minister.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Good heavens! Balsquith!
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (throwing himself into Mitchener's chair). Yes: it is indeed
      Balsquith. It has come to this: that the only way that the Prime Minister
      of England can get from Downing Street to the War Office is by assuming
      this disguise; shrieking "VOTES for Women"; and chaining himself to your
      doorscraper. They were at the corner in force. They cheered me.
      Bellachristina herself was there. She shook my hand and told me to say I
      was a vegetarian, as the diet was better in Holloway for vegetarians.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Why didnt you telephone?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. They tap the telephone. Every switchboard in London is in their
      hands or in those of their young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Where on Earth did you get that dress?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. I stole it from a little Exhibition got up by my wife in
      Downing Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. You dont mean to say its a French dress?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Great Heavens, no. My wife isnt allowed even to put on her
      gloves with French chalk. Everything labelled Made in Camberwell. She
      advised me to come to you. And what I have to say must be said here to you
      personally, in the most intimate confidence, with the most urgent
      persuasion. Mitchener: Sandstone has resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (amazed). Old Red resigned!
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. But how? Why? Oh, impossible! the proclamation of martial law
      last Tuesday made Sandstone virtually Dictator in the metropolis, and to
      resign now is flat desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Yes, yes, my dear Mitchener; I know all that as well as you do:
      I argued with him until I was black in the face and he so red about the
      neck that if I had gone on he would have burst. He is furious because we
      have abandoned his plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. But you accepted it unconditionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Yes, before we knew what it was. It was unworkable, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I dont know. Why is it unworkable?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. I mean the part about drawing a cordon round Westminster at a
      distance of two miles; and turning all women out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. A masterpiece of strategy. Let me explain. The Suffragets are a
      very small body; but they are numerous enough to be troublesome&mdash;even
      dangerous&mdash;when they are all concentrated in one place&mdash;say in
      Parliament Square. But by making a two-mile radius and pushing them beyond
      it, you scatter their attack over a circular line twelve miles long. A
      superb piece of tactics. Just what Wellington would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But the women wont go.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Nonsense: they must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. They wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What does Sandstone say?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. He says: Shoot them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Youre not serious?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Im perfectly serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But you cant shoot them down! Women, you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (straddling confidently). Yes you can. Strange as it may seem to
      you as a civilian, Balsquith, if you point a rifle at a woman and fire it,
      she will drop exactly as a man drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But suppose your own daughters&mdash;Helen and Georgina.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. My daughters would not dream of disobeying the proclamation.
      (As an after thought.) At least Helen wouldnt.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But Georgina?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Georgina would if she knew shed be shot if she didnt. Thats how
      the thing would work. Military methods are really the most merciful in the
      end. You keep sending these misguided women to Holloway and killing them
      slowly and inhumanely by ruining their health; and it does no good: they
      go on worse than ever. Shoot a few, promptly and humanely; and there will
      be an end at once of all resistance and of all the suffering that
      resistance entails.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But public opinion would never stand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (walking about and laying down the law). Theres no such thing as
      public opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. No such thing as public opinion!!
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Absolutely no such thing as public opinion. There are certain
      persons who entertain certain opinions. Well, shoot them down. When you
      have shot them down, there are no longer any persons entertaining those
      opinions alive: consequently there is no longer any more of the public
      opinion you are so much afraid of. Grasp that fact, my dear Balsquith; and
      you have grasped the secret of government. Public opinion is mind. Mind is
      inseparable from matter. Shoot down the matter and you kill the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But hang it all&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (intolerantly). No I wont hang it all. It's no use coming to me
      and talking about public opinion. You have put yourself into the hands of
      the army; and you are committed to military methods. And the basis of all
      military methods is that when people wont do what they are told to do, you
      shoot them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Oh, yes; it's all jolly fine for you and Old Red. You dont
      depend on votes for your places. What do you suppose will happen at the
      next election?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Have no next election. Bring in a Bill at once repealing all
      the reform Acts and vesting the Government in a properly trained
      magistracy responsible only to a Council of War. It answers perfectly in
      India. If anyone objects, shoot him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But none of the members of my party would be on the Council of
      War. Neither should I. Do you expect us to vote for making ourselves
      nobodies?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. You'll have to, sooner or later, or the Socialists will make
      nobodies of the lot of you by collaring every penny you possess. Do you
      suppose this damned democracy can be allowed to go on now that the mob is
      beginning to take it seriously and using its power to lay hands on
      property? Parliament must abolish itself. The Irish parliament voted for
      its own extinction. The English parliament will do the same if the same
      means are taken to persuade it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. That would cost a lot of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Not money necessarily. Bribe them with titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Do you think we dare?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (scornfully). Dare! Dare! What is life but daring, man? "To
      dare, to dare, and again to dare"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WOMAN'S VOICE OUTSIDE. Votes for Women!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchener, revolver in hand, rushes to the door and locks it. Balsquith
      hides under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shot is heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (emerging in the greatest alarm). Good heavens, you havent given
      orders to fire on them have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. No; but its a sentinel's duty to fire on anyone who persists in
      attempting to pass without giving the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (wiping his brow). This military business is really awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Be calm, Balsquith. These things must happen; they save
      bloodshed in the long run, believe me. Ive seen plenty of it; and I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. I havent; and I dont know. I wish those guns didnt make such a
      devil of a noise. We must adopt Maxim's Silencer for the army rifles if we
      are going to shoot women. I really couldnt stand hearing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one outside tries to open the door and then knocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER and BALSQUITH. Whats that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Whos there?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. It's only me, governor. Its all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (unlocking the door and admitting the Orderly, who comes between
      them). What was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Suffraget, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Did the sentry shoot her?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. No, Sir: she shot the sentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (relieved). Oh: is that all?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (most indignantly). All? A civilian shoots down one of His
      Majesty's soldiers on duty; and the Prime Minister of England asks Is that
      all? Have you no regard for the sanctity of human life?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (much relieved). Well, getting shot is what a soldier is for.
      Besides, he doesnt vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Neither do the Suffragets.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Their husbands do. (To the Orderly.) By the way, did she kill
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. No, Sir. He got a stinger on his trousers, Sir; but it didnt
      penetrate. He lost his temper a bit and put down his gun and clouted her
      head for her. So she said he was no gentleman; and we let her go, thinking
      she'd had enough, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (groaning). Clouted her head! These women are making the army as
      lawless as themselves. Clouted her head indeed! A purely civil procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Any orders, Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. No. Yes. No. Yes: send everybody who took part in this
      disgraceful scene to the guardroom. No. Ill address the men on the subject
      after lunch. Parade them for that purpose&mdash;full kit. Don't grin at
      me, Sir. Right about face. March. (The Orderly obeys and goes out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (taking Mitchener affectionately by the arm and walking him
      persuasively to and fro). And now, Mitchener, will you come to the rescue
      of the Government and take the command that Old Red has thrown up?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. How can I? You know that the people are devoted heart and soul
      to Sandstone. He is only bringing you "on the knee," as we say in the
      army. Could any other living man have persuaded the British nation to
      accept universal compulsory military service as he did last year? Why,
      even the Church refused exemption. He is supreme&mdash;omnipotent.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. He WAS, a year ago. But ever since your book of reminiscences
      went into two more editions than his, and the rush for it led to the
      wrecking of the Times Book Club, you have become to all intents and
      purposes his senior. He lost ground by saying that the wrecking was got up
      by the booksellers. It showed jealousy: and the public felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. But I cracked him up in my book&mdash;you see I could do no
      less after the handsome way he cracked me up in his&mdash;and I cant go
      back on it now. (Breaking loose from Balsquith.) No: its no use,
      Balsquith: he can dictate his terms to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Not a bit of it. That affair of the curate&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (impatiently). Oh, damn that curate. Ive heard of nothing but
      that wretched mutineer for a fortnight past. He is not a curate: whilst he
      is serving in the army he is a private soldier and nothing else. I really
      havent time to discuss him further. Im busy. Good morning. (He sits down
      at his table and takes up his letters.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (near the door). I am sorry you take that tone, Mitchener. Since
      you do take it, let me tell you frankly that I think Lieutenant
      Chubbs-Jenkinson showed a great want of consideration for the Government
      in giving an unreasonable and unpopular order, and bringing compulsory
      military service into disrepute. When the leader of the Labor Party
      appealed to me and to the House last year not to throw away all the
      liberties of Englishmen by accepting universal Compulsory military service
      without insisting on full civil rights for the soldier&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Rot.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. &mdash;I said that no British officer would be capable of
      abusing the authority with which it was absolutely necessary to invest
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Quite right.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. That carried the House and carried the country&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. &mdash;And the feeling was that the Labor Party were soulless
      cads.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. So they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. And now comes this unmannerly young whelp Chubbs-Jenkinson, the
      only son of what they call a soda king, and orders a curate to lick his
      boots. And when the curate punches his head, you first sentence him to be
      shot; and then make a great show of clemency by commuting it to a
      flogging. What did you expect the curate to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (throwing down his pen and his letters and jumping up to
      confront Balsquith). His duty was perfectly simple. He should have obeyed
      the order; and then laid his complaint against the officer in proper form.
      He would have received the fullest satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. What satisfaction?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Chubbs-Jenkinson would have been reprimanded. In fact, he WAS
      reprimanded. Besides, the man was thoroughly insubordinate. You cant deny
      that the very first thing he did when they took him down after flogging
      him was to walk up to Chubbs-Jenkinson and break his jaw. That showed
      there was no use flogging him; so now he will get two years hard labor;
      and serve him right.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. I bet you a guinea he wont get even a week. I bet you another
      that Chubbs-Jenkinson apologizes abjectly. You evidently havent heard the
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What news?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. It turns out that the curate is well connected. (Mitchener
      staggers at the shock. Speechless he contemplates Balsquith with a wild
      and ghastly stare; then reels into his chair and buries his face in his
      hands over the blotter. Balsquith continues remorselessly, stooping over
      him to rub it in.) He has three aunts in the peerage; and Lady Richmond's
      one of them; (Mitchener utters a heartrending groan) and they all adore
      him. The invitations for six garden parties and fourteen dances have been
      cancelled for all the subalterns in Chubbs's regiment. Is it possible you
      havent heard of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (shaking his head). I suppose nobody dared to tell you. (He sits
      down carelessly on Mitchener's right.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What an infernal young fool Chubbs-Jenkinson is, not to know
      the standing of his man better! Why didnt he know? It was his business to
      know. He ought to be flogged.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Probably he will be, by the other subalterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I hope so. Anyhow, out he goes! Out of the army! He or I.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. His father has subscribed a million to the party funds. We owe
      him a peerage.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I dont care.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. I do. How do you think parties are kept up? Not by the
      subscriptions of the local associations, I hope. They dont pay for the gas
      at the meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Man; can you not be serious? Here are we, face to face with
      Lady Richmond's grave displeasure; and you talk to me about gas and
      subscriptions. Her own nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (gloomily). Its unfortunate. He was at Oxford with Bobby
      Bassborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Worse and worse. What shall we do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Balsquith shakes his head. They contemplate one another in miserable
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A VOICE WITHOUT. Votes for Women! Votes for Women!
    </p>
    <p>
      A terrific explosion shakes the building&mdash;they take no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (breaking down). You dont know what this means to me, Balsquith.
      I love the army. I love my country.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. It certainly is rather awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (angrily). What is it? How dare you interrupt us like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Didnt you hear the explosion, Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Explosion. What explosion? No: I heard no explosion: I have
      something more serious to attend to than explosions. Great Heavens: Lady
      Richmond's nephew has been treated like any common laborer; and while
      England is reeling under the shock a private comes in and asks me if I
      heard an explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. By the way, what was the explosion?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Only a sort of bombshell, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Bombshell!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. A pasteboard one, Sir. Full of papers with Votes for Women in
      red letters. Fired into the yard from the roof of the Alliance Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Pooh! Go away. Go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly, bewildered, goes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Mitchener: you can save the country yet. Put on your full-dress
      uniform and your medals and orders and so forth. Get a guard of honor&mdash;something
      showy&mdash;horse guards or something of that sort; and call on the old
      girl&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. The old girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Well, Lady Richmond. Apologize to her. Ask her leave to accept
      the command. Tell her that youve made the curate your adjutant or your
      aide-de-camp or whatever is the proper thing. By the way, what can you
      make him?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I might make him my chaplain. I dont see why I shouldnt have a
      chaplain on my staff. He showed a very proper spirit in punching that
      young cub's head. I should have done the same myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Then Ive your promise to take command if Lady Richmond
      consents?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. On condition that I have a free hand. No nonsense about public
      opinion or democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. As far as possible, I think I may say yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (rising intolerantly and going to the hearthrug). That wont do
      for me. Dont be weak-kneed, Balsquith. You know perfectly well that the
      real government of this country is and always must be the government of
      the masses by the classes. You know that democracy is damned nonsense, and
      that no class stands less of it than the working class. You know that we
      are already discussing the steps that will have to be taken if the country
      should ever be face to face with the possibility of a Labor majority in
      parliament. You know that in that case we should disfranchise the mob,
      and, if they made a fuss, shoot them down. You know that if we need public
      opinion to support us, we can get any quantity of it manufactured in our
      papers by poor devils of journalists who will sell their souls for five
      shillings. You know&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Stop. Stop, I say. I dont know. That is the difference between
      your job and mine, Mitchener. After twenty years in the army a man thinks
      he knows everything. After twenty months in the Cabinet he knows that he
      knows nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. We learn from history&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. We learn from history that men never learn anything from
      history. Thats not my own: its Hegel.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Whos Hegel?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Dead. A German philosopher. (He half rises, but recollects
      something and sits down again.) Oh confound it: that reminds me. The
      Germans have laid down four more Dreadnoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Then you must lay down twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Oh yes: its easy to say that: but think of what theyll cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Think of what it would cost to be invaded by Germany and forced
      to pay an indemnity of five hundred millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But you said that if you got compulsory military service there
      would be an end of the danger of invasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. On the contrary, my dear fellow, it increases the danger
      tenfold, because it increases German jealousy of our military supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. After all, why should the Germans invade us?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Why shouldnt they? What else has their army to do? What else
      are they building a navy for?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Well, we never think of invading Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Yes we do. I have thought of nothing else for the last ten
      years. Say what you will, Balsquith, the Germans have never recognized,
      and until they get a stern lesson, they never WILL recognize, the plain
      fact that the interests of the British Empire are paramount, and that the
      command of the sea belongs by nature to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. But if they wont recognize it, what can I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Shoot them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. I cant shoot them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Yes you can. You dont realize it; but if you fire a rifle into
      a German he drops just as surely as a rabbit does.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH But dash it all, man, a rabbit hasnt got a rifle and a German
      has. Suppose he shoots you down.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Excuse me, Balsquith; but that consideration is what we call
      cowardice in the army. A soldier always assumes that he is going to shoot,
      not to be shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (jumping up and walking about sulkily). Oh come! I like to hear
      you military people talking of cowardice. Why, you spend your lives in an
      ecstasy of terror of imaginary invasions. I dont believe you ever go to
      bed without looking under it for a burglar.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (calmly). A very sensible precaution, Balsquith. I always take
      it. And in consequence Ive never been burgled.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Neither have I. Anyhow dont you taunt me with cowardice. (He
      posts himself on the hearthrug beside Mitchener on his left.) I never look
      under my bed for a burglar. Im not always looking under the nation's bed
      for an invader. And if it comes to fighting Im quite willing to fight
      without being three to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. These are the romantic ravings of a Jingo civilian, Balsquith.
      At least youll not deny that the absolute command of the sea is essential
      to our security.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. The absolute command of the sea is essential to the security of
      the principality of Monaco. But Monaco isnt going to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. And consequently Monaco enjoys no security. What a frightful
      thing! How do the inhabitants sleep with the possibility of invasion, of
      bombardment, continually present to their minds? Would you have our
      English slumbers broken in the same way? Are we also to live without
      security?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (dogmatically). Yes. Theres no such thing as security in the
      world: and there never can be as long as men are mortal. England will be
      secure when England is dead, just as the streets of London will be safe
      when there is no longer a man in her streets to be run over, or a vehicle
      to run over him. When you military chaps ask for security you are crying
      for the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (very seriously). Let me tell you, Balsquith, that in these days
      of aeroplanes and Zeppelin airships, the question of the moon is becoming
      one of the greatest importance. It will be reached at no very distant
      date. Can you as an Englishman, tamely contemplate the possibility of
      having to live under a German moon? The British flag must be planted there
      at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. My dear Mitchener, the moon is outside practical politics. Id
      swop it for a cooling station tomorrow with Germany or any other Power
      sufficiently military in its way of thinking to attach any importance to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (losing his temper). You are the friend of every country but
      your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Say nobodys enemy but my own. It sounds nicer. You really
      neednt be so horribly afraid of the other countries. Theyre all in the
      same fix as we are. Im much more interested in the death rate in Lambeth
      than in the German fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. You darent say that in Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Ill say it the day after you publish your scheme for invading
      Germany and repealing all the reform Acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What do you want?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. I dont want anything, Governor, thank you. The secretary and
      president of the Anti-Suffraget League say they had an appointment with
      the Prime Minister, and that theyve been sent on here from Downing Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (going to the table). Quite right. I forgot them. (To
      Mitchener.) Would you mind my seeing them here? I feel extraordinarily
      grateful to these women for standing by us and facing the suffragets,
      especially as they are naturally the gentler and timid sort of women. (The
      Orderly moans.) Did you say anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. No, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Did you catch their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Yes, Sir. The president is Lady Corinthia Fanshawe; and the
      secretary is Mrs. Banger.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (abruptly). Mrs. what?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Mrs. Banger.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Curious that quiet people always seem to have violent names.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Not much quiet about her, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (outraged). Attention. Speak when youre spoken to. Hold your
      tongue when youre not. Right about face. March. (The Orderly obeys.) Thats
      the way to keep these chaps up to the mark. (The Orderly returns.) Back
      again! What do you mean by this mutiny?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. What am I to say to the ladies, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. You dont mind my seeing them somewhere, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Not at all. Bring them in to see me when youve done with them:
      I understand that Lady Corinthia is a very fascinating woman. Who is she,
      by the way?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Daughter of Lord Broadstairs, the automatic turbine man. Gave
      quarter of a million to the party funds. Shes musical and romantic and all
      that&mdash;dont hunt: hates politics: stops in town all the year round:
      one never sees her anywhere except at the opera and at musical at-homes
      and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What a life! Still, if she wants to see me I dont mind. (To the
      Orderly.) Where are the ladies?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. In No. 17, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Show Mr. Balsquith there. And send Mrs. Farrell here.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (calling into the corridor). Mrs. Farrell! (To Balsquith.)
      This way sir. (He goes out with Balsquith.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farrell, a lean, highly respectable Irish Charwoman of about 50 comes
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Mrs. Farrell: Ive a very important visit to pay: I shall want
      my full dress uniform and all my medals and orders and my presentation
      sword. There was a time when the British Army contained men capable of
      discharging these duties for their commanding officer. Those days are
      over. The compulsorily enlisted soldier runs to a woman for everything. Im
      therefore reluctantly obliged to trouble you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS FARRELL. Your meddles n ordhers n the crooked sword with the ivory
      handle n your full dress uniform is in the waxworks in the Chamber o
      Military Glory over in the place they used to call the Banquetin Hall. I
      told you youd be sorry for sendin them away; n you told me to mind me own
      business. Youre wiser now.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I am. I had not at that time discovered that you were the only
      person in the whole military establishment of this capital who could be
      trusted to remember where anything was, or to understand an order and obey
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Its no good flattherin me. Im too old.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Not at all, Mrs. Farrell. How is your daughter?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Which daughther.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. The one who has made such a gratifying success in the Music
      Halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Theres no music halls nowadays: theyre Variety Theatres.
      Shes got an offer of marriage from a young jook.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Is it possible? What did you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. I told his mother on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Oh! what did she say?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. She was as pleased as Punch. Thank Heaven, she says, hes got
      somebody thatll be able to keep him when the supertax is put up to twenty
      shillings in the pound.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. But your daughter herself? What did she say?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Accepted him, of course. What else would a young fool like
      her do? He inthrojooced her to the Poet Laureate, thinking shed inspire
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Did she?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Faith I dunna. All I know is she walked up to him as bold as
      brass n said "Write me a sketch, dear." Afther all the trouble I took with
      that chills manners shes no more notion how to behave herself than a pig.
      Youll have to wear General Sandstones uniform: its the ony one in the
      place, because he wont lend it to the shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. But Sandstones clothes wont fit me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL (unmoved). Then youll have to fit THEM. Why shouldnt they
      fitcha as well as they fitted General Blake at the Mansion House?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. They didnt fit him. He looked a frightful guy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Well, you must do the best you can with them. You cant
      exhibit your clothes and wear them too.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. And the public thinks the lot of a commanding officer a happy
      one! Oh, if they could only see the seamy side of it. (He returns to his
      table to resume work.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. If they could only see the seamy side of General Sandstones
      uniform, where his flask rubs agen the buckle of his braces, theyll tell
      him he ought to get a new one. Let alone the way he swears at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. When a man has risked his life on eight battlefields, Mrs.
      Farrell, he has given sufficient proof of his self-control to be excused a
      little strong language.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Would you put up with bad language from me because Ive
      risked my life eight times in childbed?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. My dear Mrs. Farrell, you surely would not compare a risk of
      that harmless domestic kind to the fearful risks of the battlefield?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. I wouldnt compare risks run to bear living people into the
      world to risks run to blow them out of it. A mother's risk is jooty: a
      soldier's nothin but divilmint.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (nettled). Let me tell you, Mrs. Farrell, that if the men did
      not fight, the women would have to fight themselves. We spare you that, at
      all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. You cant help yourselves. If three-quarters of you was
      killed we could replace you with the help of the other quarter. If
      three-quarters of us was killed, how many people would there be in England
      in another generation? If it wasnt for that, the man d put the fightin on
      us just as they put all the other dhrudgery. What would YOU do if we was
      all kilt? Would you go to bed and have twins?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Really, Mrs. Farrell, you must discuss these questions with a
      medical man. You make me blush, positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. A good job too. If I could have made Farrell blush I wouldnt
      have had to risk me life too often. You n your risks n your bravery n your
      selfcontrol indeed! "Why don't you conthrol yourself?" I sez to Farrell.
      "Its agen me religion," he sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (plaintively). Mrs. Farrell, youre a woman of very powerful
      mind. Im not qualified to argue these delicate matters with you. I ask you
      to spare me, and to be good enough to take these clothes to Mr. Balsquith
      when the ladies leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Lady Corinthia Fanshawe and Mrs. Banger wish to see you, sir.
      Mr. Balsquith told me to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Theyve come about the vote. I dont know whether its them
      that want it or them that doesnt want it: anyhow, they're all alike when
      they get into a state about it. (She goes out, having gathered Balsquith's
      suffraget disguise from the desk.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Is Mr. Balsquith not with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. No, Sir. Couldnt stand Mrs. Banger, I expect. Fair caution
      she is. (He chuckles.) Couldnt help larfin when I sor im op it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. How dare you indulge in this unseemly mirth in the presence of
      your commanding officer? Have you no sense of a soldier's duty?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (sadly). Im afraid I shant ever get the ang of it, sir. You
      see my father has a tidy little barbers business down off Shoreditch; and
      I was brought up to be chatty and easy like with everybody. I tell you,
      when I drew the number in the conscription it gave my old mother the
      needle and it gev me the ump. I should take it very kind, sir, if youd let
      me off the drill and let me shave you instead. Youd appreciate my
      qualities then: you would indeed sir. I shant never do myself justice at
      soljering, sir: I cant bring myself to think of it as proper work for a
      man with an active mind, as you might say, sir. Arf of its only
      ousemaidin; and the other arf is dress-up and make-believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Stuff, Sir. Its the easiest life in the world. Once you learn
      your drill all you have to do is to hold your tongue and obey your orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. But I do assure you, sir, arf the time they're the wrong
      orders; and I get into trouble when I obey them. The sergeants orders is
      all right; but the officers dont know what theyre talkin about. Why the
      orses knows better sometimes. "Fours" says Lieutenant Trevor at the gate
      of Bucknam Palace only this morning when we was on duty for a State visit
      to the Coal Trust. I was fourth man like in the first file; and when I
      started the orse eld back; and the sergeant was on to me straight. Threes,
      you bally fool, he whispers. And he was on to me again about it when we
      came back, and called me a fathead, he did. What am I to do, I says: the
      lieutenant's orders was fours, I says. Ill show you whos lieutenant here,
      e says. In future you attend to my orders and not to iz, e says: what does
      he know about it? You didnt give me any orders, I says. Couldnt you see
      for yourself there wasnt room for fours, e says: why cant you THINK?
      General Mitchener tells me Im not to think but to obey orders, I says. Is
      Mitchener your sergeant or am I, e says in his bullyin way. You are, I
      says. Well, he says, youve got to do what your sergeant tells you: thats
      discipline, he says. What am I to do for the General I says. Youre to let
      im talk, e says: thats what es for.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (groaning). It is impossible for the human mind to conceive
      anything more dreadful than this. Youre a disgrace to the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (deeply wounded). The service is a disgrace to me. When my
      mother's people pass me in the street with this uniform on, I ardly know
      which way to look. There never was a soldier in my family before.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. There never was anything else in mine, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. My mother's second cousin was one of the Parkinsons of
      Stepney. (Almost in tears.) What do you know of the feelings of a
      respectable family in the middle station of life? I cant bear to be looked
      down on as a common soldier. Why cant my father be let buy my discharge?
      Youve done away with the soldier's right to have his discharge bought for
      him by his relations. The country didnt know you were going to do that or
      it would never have stood it. Is an Englishman to be made a mockery like
      this?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Silence. Attention. Right about face. March.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (retiring to the standing desk and bedewing it with passionate
      tears). Oh that I should have lived to be spoke to as if I was the lowest
      of the low. Me! that has shaved a City of London aldermen wiv me own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Poltroon. Crybaby. Well, better disgrace yourself here than
      disgrace your country on the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (angrily coming to the table). Whos going to disgrace his
      country on the field of battle? Its not fightin I object to: its soljerin.
      Show me a German and Ill have a go at him as fast as you or any man. But
      to ave me time wasted like this, an be stuck in a sentry box at a street
      corner for an ornament to be stared at; and to be told "right about face:
      march" if I speak as one man to another: that aint pluck: that aint
      fightin: that aint patriotism: its bein made a bloomin sheep of.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. A sheep has many valuable military qualities. Emulate them:
      dont disparage them.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Oh, wots the good of talkin to you? If I wasnt a poor soldier
      I could punch your head for forty shillins for a month. But because youre
      my commanding officer you deprive me of my right to a magistrate and make
      a compliment of giving me two years ard sted of shootin me. Why cant you
      take your chance the same as any civilian does?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (rising majestically). I search the pages of history in vain for
      a parallel to such a speech made by a Private to a general. But for the
      coherence of your remarks I should conclude that you were drunk. As it is,
      you must be mad. You shall be placed under restraint at once. Call the
      guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Call your grandmother. If you take one man off the doors the
      place'll be full of Suffragets before you can wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Then arrest yourself; and off with you to the guardroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. What am I to arrest myself for?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Thats nothing to you. You have your orders: obey them. Do you
      hear? Right about face. March.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. How would you feel yourself if you was told to
      right-about-face and march as if you was a doormat?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I should feel as if my country had spoken through the voice of
      my officer. I should feel proud and honored to be able to serve my country
      by obeying its commands. No thought of self&mdash;no vulgar preoccupation
      with my own petty vanity could touch my mind at such a moment. To me my
      officer would not be a mere man: he would be for the moment&mdash;whatever
      his personal frailties&mdash;the incarnation of our national destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. What Im saying to you is the voice of old England a jolly
      sight more than all this rot that you get out of books. Id rather be spoke
      to by a sergeant than by you. He tells me to go to hell when I challenges
      him to argue it out like a man. It aint polite; but its English. What you
      say aint anything at all. You dont act on it yourself. You dont believe in
      it. Youd punch my head if I tried it on you; and serve me right. And look
      here. Heres another point for you to argue.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (with a shriek of protest). No&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Banger comes in, followed by Lady Corinthia Fanshawe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Banger is a masculine woman of forty, with a powerful voice and great
      physical strength. Lady Corinthia, who is also over thirty, is beautiful
      and romantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER (throwing the door open decisively and marching straight to
      Michener). Pray how much longer is the Anti-Suffrage League to be kept
      waiting? (She passes him contemptuously and sits down with impressive
      confidence in the chair next the fireplace. Lady Corinthia takes the chair
      on the opposite side of the table with equal aplomb.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Im extremely sorry. You really do not know what I have to put
      with. This imbecile, incompetent, unsoldierly disgrace to the uniform he
      should never have been allowed to put on, ought to have shown you in
      fifteen minutes ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. All I said was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Not another word. Attention. Right about face. March. (The
      Orderly sits down doggedly.) Get out of the room this instant, you fool,
      or Ill kick you out.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (civilly). I dont mind that, sir. Its human. Its English. Why
      couldnt you have said it before? (He goes out).
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Take no notice I beg: these scenes are of daily occurrence now
      that we have compulsory service under the command of the halfpenny papers.
      Pray sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA AND MRS. BANGER (rising). Thank you. (They sit down again.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (sitting down with a slight chuckle of satisfaction). And now,
      ladies, to what am I indebted?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. Let me introduce us. I am Rosa Carmina Banger&mdash;Mrs.
      Banger, organizing secretary of the Anti-Suffraget League. This is Lady
      Corinthia Fanshawe, the president of the League, known in musical circles&mdash;I
      am not myself musical&mdash;as the Richmond Park nightingale. A soprano. I
      am myself said to be almost a baritone; but I do not profess to understand
      these dis-tinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (murmuring politely). Most happy, Im sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. We have come to tell you plainly that the Anti-Suffragets are
      going to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (gallantly). Oh, pray leave that to the men, Mrs. Banger.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. We can no longer trust the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. They have shown neither the strength, the courage, nor the
      determination which are needed to combat women like the Suffragets.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Nature is too strong for the combatants.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. Physical struggles between persons of opposite sexes are
      unseemly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Demoralizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. Insincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. They are merely embraces in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. No such suspicion can attach to combats in which the
      antagonists are of the same sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. The Anti-Suffragets have resolved to take the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. They will enforce the order of General Sandstone for the
      removal of all women from the two mile radius&mdash;that is, all women
      except themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I am sorry to have to inform you, Madam, that the Government
      has given up that project, and that General Sandstone has resigned in
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. That does not concern us in the least. We approve of the
      project and will see that it is carried out. We have spent a good deal of
      money arming ourselves; and we are not going to have that money thrown
      away through the pusillanimity of a Cabinet of males.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Arming yourselves! But, my dear ladies, under the latest
      proclamation women are strictly forbidden to carry chains, padlocks,
      tracts on the franchise, or weapons of any description.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (producing an ivory-handled revolver and pointing it at his
      nose). You little know your countrywomen, General Mitchener.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (without flinching). Madam: it is my duty to take possession of
      that weapon in accordance with the proclamation. Be good enough to put it
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER (producing an XVIII century horse pistol). Is it your duty to
      take possession of this also?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. That, madam, is not a weapon; it is a curiosity. If you would
      be kind enough to place it in some museum instead of pointing it at my
      head, I should be obliged to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. This pistol, sir, was carried at Waterloo by my grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I presume you mean your grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. You presume unwarrantably.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Mrs. Banger's grandmother commanded a canteen at that
      celebrated battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. Who my grandfather was is a point that has never been quite
      clearly settled. I put my trust not in my ancestors, but in my good sword,
      which is at my lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Your sword!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. The sword with which I slew five Egyptians with my own hand
      at Kassassin, where I served as a trooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Lord bless me! But was your sex never discovered?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. It was never even suspected. I had a comrade&mdash;a
      gentleman ranker&mdash;whom they called Fanny. They never called ME Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. The suffragets have turned the whole woman movement on to
      the wrong track. They ask for a vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. What use is a vote? Men have the vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. And men are slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. What women need is the right to military service. Give me a
      well-mounted regiment of women with sabres, opposed to a regiment of men
      with votes. We shall see which will go down before the other. (rises) No:
      we have had enough of these gentle pretty creatures who merely talk and
      cross-examine ministers in police courts, and go to prison like sheep, and
      suffer and sacrifice themselves. This question must be solved by blood and
      iron, as was well said by Bismarck, whom I have reason to believe was a
      woman in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Bismarck a woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. All the really strong men of history have been disguised
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (remonstrating). My dear lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. How can you tell? You never knew that the hero of the charge
      at Kassassin was a woman: yet she was: it was I, Rosa Carmina Banger.
      Would Napoleon have been so brutal to women, think you, had he been a man?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Oh, come, come! Really! Surely female rulers have often shown
      all the feminine weaknesses. Queen Elizabeth, for instance. Her vanity,
      her levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. Nobody who has studied the history of Queen Elizabeth can
      doubt for a moment that she was a disguised man.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (admiring Mrs. Banger). Isnt she splendid?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER (rising with a large gesture). This very afternoon I shall
      cast off this hampering skirt for ever; mount my charger; and with my good
      sabre lead the Anti-Suffragets to victory. (She strides to the other side
      of the room, snorting.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. But I cant allow anything of the sort, madam. I shall stand no
      such ridiculous nonsense. Im perfectly determined to put my foot down.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Dont be hysterical, General.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Hysterical!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. Do you think we are to be stopped by these childish
      exhibitions of temper. They are useless; and your tears and entreaties&mdash;a
      man's last resource&mdash;will avail you just as little. I sweep them
      away, just as I sweep your plans of campaign "made in Germany&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (flying into a transport of rage). How dare you repeat that
      infamous slander? (He rings the bell violently.) If this is the
      alternative to votes for women, I shall advocate giving every woman in the
      country six votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remove that woman. See that she leaves the building at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly forlornly contemplates the iron front presented by Mrs.
      Banger.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (propitiatorily). Would you av the feelin art to step out,
      madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER. You are a soldier. Obey your orders. Put me out. If I got
      such an order, I should not hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (To Mitchener). Would you mind lendin me a and, Guvner?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (raising her revolver). I shall be obliged to shoot you if
      you stir, General.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BANGER (To the Orderly). When you are ordered to put a person out you
      should do it like this. (She hurls him from the room. He is heard falling
      headlong downstairs and crashing through a glass door.) I shall now wait
      on General Sandstone. If he shows any sign of weakness, he shall share
      that poor wretch's fate. (She goes out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Isnt she magnificent?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Thank heaven shes gone. And now, my dear lady, is it necessary
      to keep that loaded pistol to my nose all through our conversation?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Its not loaded. Its heavy enough, goodness knows, without
      putting bullets in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (triumphantly snatching his revolver from the drawer). Then I am
      master of the situation. This IS loaded. Ha, ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. But since we are not really going to shoot one another,
      what difference can it possibly make?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (putting his pistol down on the table). True. Quite true. I
      recognize there the practical good sense that has prevented you from
      falling into the snares of the Suffragets.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. The Suffragets, General, are the dupes of dowdies. A
      really attractive and clever woman&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (gallantly). Yourself, for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (snatching up his revolver). Another step and you are a
      dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (amazed). My dear lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. I am not your dear lady. You are not the first man who has
      concluded that because I am devoted to music and can reach F flat with the
      greatest facility&mdash;Patti never got above E flat&mdash;I am marked out
      as the prey of every libertine. You think I am like the thousands of weak
      women whom you have ruined&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I solemnly protest&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Oh, I know what you officers are. To you a woman's honor
      is nothing, and the idle pleasure of the moment is everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. This is perfectly ridiculous. I never ruined anyone in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Never! Are you in earnest?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Certainly I am in earnest. Most indignantly in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (throwing down the pistol contemptuously). Then you have no
      temperament; you are not an artist. You have no soul for music.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Ive subscribed to the regimental band all my life. I bought two
      sarrusophones for it out of my own pocket. When I sang Tosti's Goodbye for
      Ever at Knightsbridge in 1880, the whole regiment wept. You are too young
      to remember that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Your advances are useless. I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Confound it, madam, can you not receive an innocent compliment
      without suspecting me of dishonorable intentions?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Love&mdash;real love&mdash;makes all intentions honorable.
      But YOU could never understand that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Ill not submit to the vulgar penny-novelette notion that an
      officer is less honorable than a civilian in his relations with women.
      While I live Ill raise my voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Tush!
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What do you mean by tush?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. You cant raise your voice above its natural compass. What
      sort of voice have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. A tenor. What sort had you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Had? I have it still. I tell you I am the highest living
      soprano. (Scornfully.) What was your highest note, pray?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. B flat&mdash;once&mdash;in 1879. I was drunk at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (gazing at him almost tenderly). Though you may not believe
      me, I find you are more interesting when you talk about music than when
      you are endeavoring to betray a woman who has trusted you by remaining
      alone with you in your apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (springing up and fuming away to the fireplace). These repeated
      insults to a man of blameless life are as disgraceful to you as they are
      undeserved by me, Lady Corinthia. Such suspicions invite the conduct they
      impute. (She raises the pistol.) You need not be alarmed: I am only going
      to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Fish! This is worse than tush. Why fish?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Yes, fish: coldblooded fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Dash it all, madam, do you WANT me to make advances to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. I have not the slightest intention of yielding to them;
      but to make them would be a tribute to romance. What is life without
      romance?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (making a movement toward her). I tell you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Stop. No nearer. No vulgar sensuousness. If you must
      adore, adore at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. This is worse than Mrs. Banger. I shall ask that estimable
      woman to come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Poor Mrs. Banger! Do not for a moment suppose, General
      Mitchener, that Mrs. Banger represents my views on the suffrage question.
      Mrs. Banger is a man in petticoats. I am every inch a woman; but I find it
      convenient to work with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Do you find the combination comfortable?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. I do not wear combinations, General: (with dignity) they
      are unwomanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (throwing himself despairingly into the chair next the
      hearthrug). I shall go mad. I never for a moment dreamt of alluding to
      anything of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. There is no need to blush and become self-conscious at the
      mention of underclothing. You are extremely vulgar, General.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Lady Corinthia: you have my pistol. Will you have the goodness
      to blow my brains out. I should prefer it to any further effort to follow
      the gyrations of the weathercock you no doubt call your mind. If you
      refuse, then I warn you that youll not get another word out of me&mdash;not
      if we sit here until doomsday.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. I dont want you to talk. I want you to listen. You do not
      yet understand my views on the question of the Suffrage. (She rises to
      make a speech.) I must preface my remarks by reminding you that the
      Suffraget movement is essentially a dowdy movement. The suffragets are not
      all dowdies; but they are mainly supported by dowdies. Now I am not a
      dowdy. Oh, no compliments&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I did not utter a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (smiling). It is easy to read your thoughts. I am one of
      those women who are accustomed to rule the world through men. Man is ruled
      by beauty, by charm. The men who are not have no influence. The Salic Law,
      which forbade women to occupy a throne, is founded on the fact that when a
      woman is on the throne the country is ruled by men, and therefore ruled
      badly; whereas when a man is on the throne, the country is ruled by women,
      and therefore ruled well. The suffragets would degrade women from being
      rulers to being voters, mere politicians, the drudges of the caucus and
      the polling booth. We should lose our influence completely under such a
      state of affairs. The New Zealand women have the vote. What is the result?
      No poet ever makes a New Zealand woman his heroine. One might as well be
      romantic about New Zealand mutton. Look at the suffragets themselves. The
      only ones who are popular are the pretty ones, who flirt with mobs as
      ordinary women flirt with officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Then I understand you to hold that the country should be
      governed by the women after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Not by all the women. By certain women. I had almost said
      by one woman. By the women who have charm&mdash;who have artistic talent&mdash;who
      wield a legitimate, a refining influence over the men. (She sits down
      gracefully, smiling, and arranging her draperies with conscious elegance.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. In short, madam, you think that if you give the vote to the
      man, you give the power to the women who can get round the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. That is not a very delicate way of putting it; but I
      suppose that is how you would express what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Perhaps youve never had any experience of garrison life. If you
      had, you'd have noticed that the sort of woman who is clever at getting
      round men is sometimes rather a bad lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. What do you mean by a bad lot?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I mean a woman who would play the very devil if the other women
      didnt keep her in pretty strict order. I dont approve of democracy,
      because its rot; and Im against giving the vote to women because Im not
      accustomed to it and therefore am able to see with an unprejudiced eye
      what infernal nonsense it is. But I tell you plainly, Lady Corinthia, that
      there is one game that I dislike more than either Democracy or Votes For
      Women: and that is the game of Antony and Cleopatra. If I must be ruled by
      women, let me have decent women and not&mdash;well, not the other sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. You have a coarse mind, General Mitchener.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. So has Mrs. Banger. And by George! I prefer Mrs. Banger to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (bounding to her feet.) You prefer Mrs. Banger to me!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I do. You said yourself she was splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. You are no true man. You are one of those unsexed
      creatures who have no joy in life, no sense of beauty, no high notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. No doubt I am, Madam. As a matter of fact, I am not clever at
      discussing public questions, because, as an English gentleman, I was not
      brought up to use my brains. But occasionally, after a number of remarks
      which are perhaps sometimes rather idiotic, I get certain convictions.
      Thanks to you, I have now got a conviction that this woman question is not
      a question of lovely and accomplished females, but of dowdies. The average
      Englishwoman is a dowdy and never has half a chance of becoming anything
      else. She hasnt any charm; and she has no high notes except when shes
      giving her husband a piece of her mind, or calling down the street for one
      of the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. How disgusting!
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Somebody must do the dowdy work! If we had to choose between
      pitching all the dowdies into the Thames and pitching all the lovely and
      accomplished women, the lovely ones would have to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. And if you had to do without Wagner's music or do without
      your breakfast, you would do without Wagner. Pray does that make eggs and
      bacon more precious than music, or the butcher and baker better than the
      poet and philosopher? The scullery may be more necessary to our bare
      existence than the cathedral. Even humbler apartments might make the same
      claim. But which is the more essential to the higher life?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Your arguments are so devilishly ingenious that I feel
      convinced you got them out of some confounded book. Mine&mdash;such as
      they are&mdash;are my own. I imagine its something like this. There is an
      old saying that if you take care of the pence, the pounds will take care
      of themselves. Well, perhaps if we take care of the dowdies and the
      butchers and the bakers, the beauties and the bigwigs will take care of
      themselves. (Rising and facing her determinedly.) Anyhow, I dont want to
      have things arranged for me by Wagner. Im not Wagner. How does he know
      where the shoe pinches me? How do you know where the shoe pinches your
      washerwoman?&mdash;you and your high F in alt. How are you to know when
      you havent made her comfortable unless she has a vote? Do you want her to
      come and break your windows?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Am I to understand that General Mitchener is a democrat
      and a suffraget?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Yes: you have converted me&mdash;you and Mrs. Banger.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Farewell, creature. (Balsquith enters hurriedly.) Mr.
      Balsquith: I am going to wait on General Sandstone. He at least is an
      officer and a gentleman. (She sails out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Mitchener: the game is up.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. The strain is too much for the Cabinet. The old Liberal and
      Unionist Free Traders declare that if they are defeated on their
      resolution to invite tenders from private contractors for carrying on the
      Army and Navy, they will go solid for votes for women as the only means of
      restoring the liberties of the country which we have destroyed by
      compulsory military service.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Infernal impudence?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. The Labor party is taking the same line. They say the men got
      the Factory Acts by hiding behind the women's petticoats, and that they
      will get votes for the army in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Balsquith: we must not yield to clamor. I have just told this
      lady that I am at last convinced&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (joyfully). That the suffragets must be supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. No: that the anti-suffragets must be put down at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. No. For you now tell me that the Labor Party demands votes for
      women. That makes it impossible to give them, because it would be yielding
      to clamor. The one condition on which we can consent to grant anything in
      this country is that nobody shall presume to want it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (earnestly). Mitchener: its no use. You cant have the
      conveniences of Democracy without its occasional inconveniences.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. What are its conveniences, I should like to know?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. When you tell people that they are the real rulers and they can
      do what they like, nine times out of ten, they say, "All right, tell us
      what to do." But it happens sometimes that they get an idea of their own;
      and then of course youre landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Sh&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (desperately shouting him down). No: its no use telling me to
      shoot them down: Im not going to do it. After all, I dont suppose votes
      for women will make much difference. It hasnt in the other countries in
      which it has been tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I never supposed it would make much difference. What I cant
      stand is giving in to that Pankhurst lot. Hang it all, Balsquith, it seems
      only yesterday that we put them in quod for a month. I said at the time
      that it ought to have been ten years. If my advice had been taken this
      wouldnt have happened. Its a consolation to me that events are proving how
      thoroughly right I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly rushes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Look ere, sir: Mrs. Banger locked the door of General
      Sandstone's room on the inside; and shes sitting on his ead until he signs
      a proclamation for women to serve in the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Put your shoulder to the door and burst it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Its only in story books that doors burst open as easy as
      that. Besides, Im only too thankful to have a locked door between me and
      Mrs. B.; and so is all the rest of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Cowards. Balsquith: to the rescue! (He dashes out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (ambling calmly to the hearth). This is the business of the
      Sergeant at Arms rather than of the leader of the House. Theres no use in
      my tackling Mrs. Banger: she would only sit on my head too.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. You take my tip, Mr. Balsquith. Give the women the vote and
      give the army civil rights; and av done with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchener returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Balsquith: prepare to hear the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Sandstone is no more?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. On the contrary, he is particularly lively. He has softened
      Mrs. Banger by a proposal of marriage in which he appears to be perfectly
      in earnest. He says he has met his ideal at last, a really soldierly
      woman. She will sit on his head for the rest of his life; and the British
      Army is now to all intents and purposes commanded by Mrs. Banger. When I
      remonstrated with Sandstone she positively shouted "Right-about-face.
      March" at me in the most offensive tone. If she hadnt been a woman I
      should have punched her head. I precious nearly punched Sandstone's. The
      horrors of martial law administered by Mrs. Banger are too terrible to be
      faced. I demand civil rights for the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (chuckling). Wot oh, General! Wot oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Hold your tongue. (He goes to the door and calls.) Mrs.
      Farrell! (Returning, and again addressing the Orderly.) Civil rights don't
      mean the right to be uncivil. (Pleased with his own wit.) Almost a pun. Ha
      ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Whats the matther now? (She comes to the table.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (to the Orderly). I have private business with Mrs. Farrell.
      Outside, you infernal blackguard.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY (arguing, as usual). Well, I didnt ask to&mdash;(Mitchener
      seizes him by the nape; rushes him out; and slams the door).
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Excuse the abruptness of this communication, Mrs. Farrell; but
      I know only one woman in the country whose practical ability and force of
      character can maintain her husband in competition with the husband of Mrs.
      Banger. I have the honor to propose for your hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Dye mean you want to marry me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. No thank you. Id have to work for you just the same; only I
      shouldnt get any wages for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. That will be remedied when women get the vote. Ive had to
      promise that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (winningly). Mrs. Farrell: you have been charwoman here now ever
      since I took up my duties. Have you really never, in your more romantic
      moments, cast a favorable eye on my person?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Ive been too busy casting an unfavorable eye on your cloze
      and on the litther you make with your papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (wounded). Am I to understand that you refuse me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Just wait a bit. (She takes Mitchener's chair and rings up
      the telephone.) Double three oh seven Elephant.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. I trust youre not ringing for the police, Mrs. Farrell. I
      assure you Im perfectly sane.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL (into the telephone). Is that you, Eliza? (She listens for
      the answer.) Not out of bed yet! Go and pull her out by the heels, the
      lazy sthreel; and tell her her mother wants to speak to her very
      particularly about General Mitchener. (To Mitchener.) Dont you be afeard:
      I know youre sane enough when youre not talkin about the Germans. (Into
      the telephone.) Is that you, Eliza? (She listens for the answer.) Dye
      remember me givin you a clout on the side of the head for tellin me that
      if I only knew how to play me cards I could marry any general on the staff
      instead o disgracin you be bein a charwoman? (She listens for the answer.)
      Well, I can have General Mitchener without playing any cards at all. What
      dye think I ought to say? (She listens.) Well, Im no chicken myself. (To
      Mitchener.) How old are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER (with an effort). Fifty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL (into the telephone). He says hes fifty-two. (She listens;
      then, to Mitchener.) She says youre down in Who's Who as sixty-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Damn Who's Who.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL (into the telephone). Anyhow I wouldnt let that stand in the
      way. (She listens.) If I really WHAT? (She listens.)I cant hear you. If I
      really WHAT? (She listens.) WHO druv him? I never said a word to&mdash;
      Eh? (She listens.) Oh, LOVE him. Arra dont be a fool, child. (To
      Mitchener.) She wants to know do I really love you.(Into the telephone.)
      Its likely indeed Id frighten the man off with any such nonsense, at my
      age. What? (She listens.) Well, thats just what I was thinkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. May I ask what you were thinking, Mrs. Farrell? This suspense
      is awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. I was thinkin that perhaps the Duchess might like her
      daughter-in-law's mother to be a General's lady betther than to be a
      charwoman. (Into the telephone.) Waitle youre married yourself, me fine
      lady: you'll find out that every woman is a charwoman from the day shes
      married. (She listens.) Then you think I might take him? (She listens.)
      Glang, you young scald: if I had you here Id teach you manners. (She
      listens.) Thats enough now. Back wid you to bed; and be thankful Im not
      there to put me slipper across you. (She rings off.) The impudence! (To
      Mitchener.) Bless you, me childher, may you be happy, she says. (To
      Balsquith, going to his side of the room.) Give dear, old Mich me love,
      she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly opens the door, ushering in Lady Corinthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Lady Corinthia Fanshawe to speak to you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. General Mitchener: your designs on Mrs. Banger are
      defeated. She is engaged to General Sandstone. Do you still prefer her to
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Hes out o the hunt. Hes engaged to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Orderly overcome by this news reels from the door to the standing
      desk, and clutches the stool to save himself from collapsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. And extremely proud of it, Lady Corinthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (contemptuously). She suits you exactly. (Coming to
      Balsquith.) Mr. Balsquith: you at least, are not a Philistine.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. No, Lady Corinthia; but Im a confirmed bachelor. I don't want a
      wife; but I want an Egeria.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. More shame for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. Silence, woman. The position and functions of a wife may
      suit your gross nature. An Egeria is exactly what I desire to be. (To
      Balsquith.) Can you play accompaniments?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. Melodies only, I regret to say. With one finger. But my
      brother, who is a very obliging fellow, and not unlike me personally, is
      acquainted with three chords, with which he manages to accompany most of
      the comic songs of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA. I do not sing comic songs. Neither will you when I am your
      Egeria. Come. I give a musical at-home this afternoon. I will allow you to
      sit at my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH. That is my ideal of romantic happiness. It commits me exactly
      as far as I desire to venture. Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Wot price me, General? Wont you celebrate your engagement by
      doing something for me? Maynt I be promoted to be a sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Youre too utterly incompetent to discharge the duties of a
      sergeant. You are only fit to be a lieutenant. I shall recommend you for a
      commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ORDERLY. Hooray! The Parkinsons of Stepney will be proud to have me
      call on them now. Ill go and tell the sergeant what I think of him.
      Hooray! (He rushes out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL (going to the door and calling after him.) You might have the
      manners to shut the door idther you. (She shuts it and comes between
      Mitchener and Lady Corinthia.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. Poor wretch; the day after civil rights are conceded to the
      army he and Chubbs-Jenkinson will be found incapable of maintaining
      discipline. They will be sacked and replaced by really capable men. Mrs.
      Farrell: as we are engaged, and I am anxious to do the correct thing in
      every way, I am quite willing to kiss you if you wish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Youd only feel like a fool; and so would I.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. You are really the most sensible woman. Ive made an extremely
      wise choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CORINTHIA (To Balsquith). You may kiss my hand, if you wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      BALSQUITH (cautiously). I think we had better not commit ourselves too
      far. If I might carry your parasol, that would quite satisfy me. Let us
      change a subject which threatens to become embarrassing. (To Mitchener.)
      The moral of the occasion for you, Mitchener, appears to be that youve got
      to give up treating soldiers as if they were schoolboys.
    </p>
    <p>
      MITCHENER. The moral for you, Balsquith, is that youve got to give up
      treating women as if they were angels. Ha ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FARRELL. Its a mercy youve found one another out at last. That's
      enough now.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
